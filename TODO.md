# TODO

[x] Define schema for Calcaster

[x] Get GCal API key

[x] Write server to pull in GCal data

[x] Convert GCal data to Calcaster schema

[x] Encrypt (do we need to do this? suspect defining the schema will help me figure this out) and store Calcaster data

~~[ ] Link to Farcaster name registry, supply a different directory URI lookup contract (Calcaster contract references name registry)~~

~~[ ] Client can search for users by FC name, grab directory URI, display calendar~~

[ ] Generate new Google API credentials - I believe this has been compromised and Google might have deactivated them.

[ ] Fix GCal stuff - make UI for initial data creation and encryption.
